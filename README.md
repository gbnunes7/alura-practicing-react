## Introduction

This is my single-page application (SPA) developed to showcase my front-end portfolio. The front end is built with React, Vite, and JavaScript for optimal performance and dynamism. It is styled using Tailwind CSS. I set up a JSON Server to simulate a REST API. The application uses React Router for client-side routing, context API to better control to states and add a custom hook. This combination of technologies has enabled me to create a powerful and scalable SPA.
## Technologies Used

**Front-end:** 
- **Vite:**: A build tool that boasts a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

- **React:**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.

- **JavaScript:** A dynamic programming language essential for creating interactive and responsive web applications, enabling seamless manipulation of web page content and user interface.

- **React-Router-Dom:** A routing library for React, enabling navigation among views.

- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and more to style your websites without leaving your HTML.

- **Git Flow:** A branching model for Git that provides a structured approach to managing feature development, releases, and hotfixes, streamlining collaboration and ensuring consistent workflows in software projects. This model follows Semantic Git Flow conventions and utilizes semantic versioning (x.y.z) for releases.


**Back-end:**

- **Json-Server:** A tool for setting up a full fake REST API with minimal configuration, ideal for prototyping and testing. It uses a db.json file to define and manage mock data. 


## Installation

To set up and run this single-page application (SPA) on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbnunes7/alura-practicing-react
```

### Navigate to Repository

```bash
cd alura-practicing-react
```

### Install the dependencies

``` bash
npm install

json-server --watch db.json
```

### Starting the application

``` bash
npm run dev
```
This starts the React application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port).

### Deployed Version

You can also visit the deployed version of the application [here](https://alura-practicing-react.vercel.app).

## What's coming up

In the next version, new features will be added:

- Backend in Node.js
- Refactor to TypeScript
- Create a series
- Improve state management with external libraries.

## Conclusion

This application setup is intended to accelerate the development process by providing a cohesive blend of some of the best technologies in web development today. Whether you're looking to create a small prototype or build a large-scale application, this repository provides a solid foundation. Happy coding!
